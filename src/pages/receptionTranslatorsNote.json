"These texts were selected, abridged, and translated from texts written in multiple languages and posted on different websites. Punctuation errors were fixed for the reader. Please do notice that the source social network websites comply to different regulations and conventions, and not all possible sources were investigated. For example, Facebook enforces real name, whereas 5 Channel discussions are mostly anonymous. These websites and their users may also have different political / economical affiliations. Even more, though the translator made arduous efforts to ensure the reliability of the translation, the translator's language and research ability are limited. As the result of these bias factors, these abridged texts and their corresponding translations may fail to reflect the collective attitude of any group of people on any issue, and may also not correctly interpret the genuine emotion and mood of the author behind the text. Therefore, please be careful when attempting to extrapolate conclusions from these texts and do not abuse any person for their posts as abridged and presented here. If the reader notices a translation error, it would be the translator's pleasure if it could be pointed out."
